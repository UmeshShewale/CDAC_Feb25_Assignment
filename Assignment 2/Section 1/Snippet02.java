    Error: Absence of public access modifier in main method.
    Explanation: 
    In Java, the main method must be public because the JVM 
    needs to access it from outside the class to start execution. 
    If main is declared as static but not public, the JVM won't 
    recognize it as the entry point.

//Fixed Code:
public class Snippet02 {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
