Error: Absence of static keyword in line 3.
    Explanation: 
    The main method serves as the entry point of 
    the program and must be declared as static.
    This is because the JVM calls the main method 
    without creating an instance of the class.

//Fixed Code:
public class Snippet01 { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
