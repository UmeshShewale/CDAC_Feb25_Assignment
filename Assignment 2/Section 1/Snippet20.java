    Error: Complile-time error - Syntax-error occurs as semicolon ; is missing. 
    Explanation: 
    In Java, semicolon (;) acts as a terminator. It tells the compiler that statement is completed. If,
    is missing, compiler cannot determine where one statement ends, leading to a syntax error.
