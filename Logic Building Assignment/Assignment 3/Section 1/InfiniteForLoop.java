Error: run-time error - loop iterates infinately
    Explanation:
    In this code, loop runs indefinately as code is written in such away that exit 
    condition never occurs (i iterates from 0 to -infinity). To solve this error, we 
    need to use post increment operator with identifier i instead of post decrement 
    operator. This will make sure that exit condition is satisfied at some point of 
    time, thereby resolving the error.  

Fixed Error:
