Error: run-time error - loop iterates infinately
    Explanation:
    In this code, loop runs indefinately as code is written in such away that exit 
    condition never occurs (i iterates from 0 to infinity). To solve this error, we 
    to change the condition in a way that it is satisfied at some point of time, 
    thereby resolving the error. 
    The Do-while loop in Java, is executed atleast once before checking the condtion.

//Fixed Code:

public class DoWhileIncorrectCondition {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 0; 

        do {
            System.out.println(num); 
            num++; 
        } while (num == 0); 
    }
}
